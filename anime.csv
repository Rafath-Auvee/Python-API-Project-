RDG: Red Data Girl,Hodaka Murakami,"There is a reason one wears make-up on stage. Applying color to one's face is almost a spell. When one's face is different, one's personality can change."
Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria,Hoshino Kazuki,"If I abandoned you, I would be released from this pain. I would live on. But before long, I would end up seeking you again, for all my actions are ultimately devoted to you and only you. All I want is to stay on target and walk straight ahead—ignoring the losses and opposition, and even the results. That’s all I can do. Some people might call it an obsession, others may deem it a miracle—but to me and many others, my driving rationale couldn’t be more obvious and natural. There are people who understand this and there are people who don’t, and I simply happen to belong to the first group. The only difference is whether they have noticed that they don’t need boxes to make their wishes come true, and what it means to fulfill a wish. My commitment to find you comes with great suffering. Not once have I thought it’s easy. For your sake, I laughed, cried, and yelled. Because of you, I destroyed my heart, my body, and the world. Still, I’m only really alive when I’m touching the fragment of you that I carry within me. Even if I don’t reach you in the end… Even if I know the horrible outcome that awaits me… I will keep searching for you, who dwells inside Maria. I’m going to vanish. Maybe I’m getting my just deserts for being too greedy with my wish. To be honest, part of me regrets that we met, but if I were to choose between a life in which we met and a life in which we didn’t, I would always pick the former. Always. I’m sure of that, even though I may be hesitating over, wavering about, and regretting my choices all the time. I will not have accomplished anything by the time I vanish, and I’m certainly not mature enough to say that I can accept that. Even now, I’m still dreaming— …that my efforts might be rewarded with some kind of happy ending."
Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Korra,"Uh, sorry... I forgot I'm supposed to airsit, I mean babybend, I-i mean babysit the kids."
Blood-C,Fumito Nanahara,"When a person encounters that which they cannot understand, what do they do? Why, they think. But you know, the more you think about something, the further you get from the truth. Yes. Your thoughts get in the way of what your instincts desire. In the way of the real answer."
Walkure Romanze,Akane Ryūzōji,Sometimes opportunity comes in sacrifice.

Naruto,Sai,"It's because Sakura loves Sasuke that she doesn't want him to sink any lower. It's because she loves him that she wants to rescue him from the evil path he currently walks. Even if the only way to do it is to kill him with her own two hands, I believe, she's prepared to do it because she loves him."
Kuroko No Basket,Akashi Seijuurou,"When I tell you to leave, leave. In this world, winning is everything. Winners are affirmed completely, and losers are denied completely. I've never lost at anything before, and I never will. Because I always win, and I'm always right. I show no mercy to those who oppose me, not even my own parents."
Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru,Hachiman Hikigaya,"If failure is the hallmark of being young, like they say. then someone who has failed to make friends must be at the peak of his youth, right? However, I'm sure they will disagree. All of this is just their double standards at play and nothing else. Here's the bottom line: Fools that enjoy their youth should go kill themselves."
Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru,Hachiman Hikigaya,"A lone warrior surviving hundreds of battles, when it comes to losing, I'm the strongest."
